    <blockquote cite="https://airandspace.si.edu/explore/stories/wright-brothers">
        The invention of the airplane by Wilbur and Orville Wright is one of the great stories in American history.
        The Wright brothers’ invention not only solved a long-studied technical problem, but helped create an entirely
        new world.

    <!-- <q> for short quotations -->
    <p>How the Wright Brothers did researching: <q>Between 1899 and 1905, the Wright brothers’ program of research and
            experimentation led to the first airplane in 1903, and an improved, practical aircraft two years later.
            Their basic design and elements have been used in all successful airplanes ever since.</q></p>
