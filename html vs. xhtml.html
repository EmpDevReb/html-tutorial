  <h1>Why XHTML</h1>

  <p>XML is a markup language where all documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed").<br><br>
    XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML).<br><br>
    In addition, browsers ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the
    markup.
    So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling.</p>
