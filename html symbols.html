<h2>HTML Symbols</h2>

<p>Symbols that are not present on your keyboard can also be added by using entities.</p>

<h2>HTML Symbol Entities</h2>
HTML entities were described in the previous chapter.<br><br>
Many mathematical, technical, and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard.<br><br>
To add such symbols to an HTML page, you can use the entity name or the entity number (a decimal or a hexadecimal reference) for the symbol.

<h2>Test Symbols</h2>
